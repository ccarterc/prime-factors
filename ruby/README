You should be able to run this script by just running:
  ruby Prime.rb
  
I have set it up to automatically run the script.  Here are the commands that are run upon executing script:

  Primes = Prime.new
  nums = Primes.get_nums_from_to 2, 10
  multi_rows = Primes.get_multi_table nums
  Primes.display_table multi_rows, 6
  
  
You could increase the number 10 to whatever you want.  It is the number of cols and rows
The number 6 represents the number of digits to hold for each cell and it can be changed.
